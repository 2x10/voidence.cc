## Deployment
Run the installer to build the Docker enviroment:
```bash
bash installer.sh
```
Then configurate the .env file that has been created and configurate it to your needs.
After configurating the enviroment, just re-run the installer and it will be good to go.  
#
Though, in the root of the project, you can also just copy the ``.env.example`` to ``.env``, configurate it and then run ``docker compose up -d`` 
### Reverse Proxy
If you wanna run this behind a reverse proxy server such as nginx, consider something like this for your ``nginx.conf``
```nginx
server 
{
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your.cool-domain.tld;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/your/key/key.pub;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/your/key/key;

    location / 
    {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    }
}
```
